              <strong>About the crew</strong>
            <em>Futo Drift Masters</em> is a Grand Theft Auto crew of full high skilled knowledgeable drifters. The crew was established on the 19th of January 2014 by crew leader Chronic and we haven't looked back yet. We are always shredding tyres and having fun drifting our favourite car in the game. The social media outlets we currently use are YouTube, InstaGram, FaceBook, Twitter, Tumblr and Flickr. Our YouTube channel features exciting footage and Drift Montages including some of our crew memberâ€™s videos.

                <strong>About the History</strong>Starting out on PS3 we are now mainly based on PS4. We have crew meets on a regular basic and are always down for crew v's crew sessions. 
            Our crew is growing stronger and stronger day by day, month by month, and this is all down to the brilliant crew member's we have. Our little family is now a global family and we are still pushing to dominate the drifting scene on GTA. Futo Drift Masters has being getting noticed by the bigger drift crews and being asked to part take in free-roam lobbys and numerous playlists, which only goes to show how good the standard of drifting in our crew is. We are the most friendly, down to earth, no bullshit crew around.

           <h3 class="page-title">About The Car</h3>
          <p class="white">
              <strong>Futo History</strong>
              The Karin Futo is a compact two-door vehicle in Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V. The Futo is based on the 1984-1987 AE86 Toyota Corolla Levin GT-Apex Coupe. The badging on the side ("N/A Inline 20v RWD", subtitled with "Quad Throttle Body", "High Performance Injection", and "Limited Slip Differential") indicates that it is equipped with a 20-valve engine, akin to Toyota's 4A-GE 1.6L Black or Silvertop engine (this engine did not appear until 1991, it was a popular modification for the AE86). The futo is configured with a rear wheel drive with a limited slip differential (possibly contributing to the car's excellent handling). It is much more powerful than the normal 16 valve 4A-GE equipped in the AE86 during its production.

                <strong>The creator</strong>
            The car is a creation of Mike Bush, an American vehicle designer for Rockstar UK, and an AE86 enthusiast. The "Futo" name is a diminutive of the working file name during production,  "Dorifuto", a Japanese loanword for car drifting; the name also happens to rhyme with "Puto", a Spanish swear word. The Futo in GTA IV shares colour scheme, engine sound, and drive layout with Blista Compact and Hakumai. The front bumper of a Futo with additional fog light housings can be found on cabinets in a chop shop during the fourth chapter of Max Payne 3. All Futos in GTA V bear the "GT" badge on the front grill.

            <h3>Performance</h3>
            <p>The Futo is powered by a naturally-aspirated, high revving 1.6-litre inline-4 engine, with five valves per cylinder and a five-speed manual gearbox in a rear-wheel drive configuration. Acceleration is this car's party piece, getting to 60 mph in just 6.6 seconds. The top speed is astonishing for a car of this stature, achieving 165 mph (265 km/h). The chassis is firm and taut, giving the Futo stability at high speeds. The suspension is firm but not too firm, keeping the Futo flat in banked corners and stable in the S-curves, while still giving a firm, yet enjoyable ride.</p>
